# This file contains an AWS Lambda handler which responds to AWS API calls that modify the ingress
# permissions of security groups to see if the permissions now differ from the required permissions
# as specificed in the REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS variable below.
#
# Note: The permissions are not remediated within this function because doing so could possibly
# trigger a recursion issue with this Lambda function triggering itself.
#
# 2017-01-13 - Added "Ipv6Ranges" to REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS to accommodate IPv6 within Amazon VPC.
